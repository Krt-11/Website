    Hi there! I'm Krutin—a recent graduate from The Ohio State University with a
    Bachelor's in Computer Science, specializing in software development. I'm a
    full-stack software engineer with a passion for solving complex technical
    problems.
    <br />
    <br />
    Initially, I planned to pursue Mechanical Engineering, but after writing my
    first piece of code on a Raspberry Pi, I was hooked! I love turning
    theoretical concepts into real-world applications and building software that
    makes an impact. Since my freshman year at OSU, I’ve worked with both local
    and international companies to develop software solutions, helping tackle
    challenges while mentoring students interested in the same field.
    <br />
    <br />
    At my current role, I collaborate with cancer researchers to develop a tool
    that identifies cancer variants in partnership with international research
    teams. I build full-stack web applications that support this mission,
    combining my passion for software with meaningful real-world impact.
    <br />
    <br />I thrive in new challenges, constantly learning and refining my skills
    to create innovative solutions. If you’d like to connect, let’s chat!
